## *Project Topic*: 
Sunrise/Sunset Controlled Lamp (WiFi communication with a computer; computer application fetching relevant data)

## *Description*: 
We intend to design a battery powered lamp that connects to a smartphone via WiFi. The smartphone hosts an application fetching data from the https://sunrisesunset.io/ API and sends the extracted relevant data to the chip. The connection occurs periodically to update the data. The lamp will turn on after sunset. There's potential for expanding the application with additional functions like brightness control, color changes, etc.

## *Equipment Used*:

### NodeMCU v3 - ESP8266 development kit:

### LED Tape (not yet)
Work in progress, it's being sorted out right now

## *Work Breakdown by Weeks*:

19.10-02.11 - Procuring suitable equipment/understanding the microcontroller's operation and structure.

02.10-09.11 - Searching for materials to learn from and playing with example projects/waiting for ordered components; hardware documentation for the project.

09.11-23.11 - Learning Kotlin for Android app disign (Hubert) + Learning to control basic functions of the acquired equipment (both of us).

23.11-21.12 - Writing the essential part of the required code (app code + estabilishing the connection between it and the board)/building the lamp with available components.

21.12-23.12 - Refining visual elements and perfecting what's incomplete.

23.12-02.01 - Holiday break.

04.01 - Possibly declaring project readiness and preparing for assessment.
